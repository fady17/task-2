Title: The Chronicle of Elderglen

Part I: The Whispering Woods

In the year of our Lord 1065, before the Norman banners flew over England, nestled amidst the rolling green hills of Wessex, there lay a village known as Elderglen. Surrounded by ancient woods and shadowed by legends, the village was a place of simplicity and survival. Its people, clad in wool and linen, tilled the land, raised livestock, and worshipped in the stone chapel that overlooked the vale.

Ealdred, the village elder, was a man of seventy winters. With a beard as white as chalk and eyes that had seen both harvest and hunger, he was known not just for his wisdom, but for the tales he told by firelight. The children of Elderglen would gather around him each evening as the hearth glowed and smoke curled into the thatched roofs.

“The forest speaks, if ye listen close,” Ealdred often said. “Not with words, nay—but with rustles and winds, and the cawing of the raven.”

One dusk, a hunter named Oswin failed to return from the woods. His wife, Leofwyn, wept at the chapel door, begging Father Edric for prayers. Some whispered that the forest spirits had taken him. Others feared bandits or worse—wolves.

Part II: The Lord’s Summons

Three days after Oswin’s disappearance, a rider clad in chainmail approached from the east. He bore the standard of Lord Cynric of Aethelmere, who ruled the region from his wooden hall atop Dunmere Hill.

“By order of Lord Cynric,” the rider proclaimed, “all able-bodied men shall gather. There is word of a threat from the north—Norse raiders have been seen near the coast.”

Elderglen’s peace shattered. The village smith, young Aethelbald, was among those called. So too was Ceolric, a farmer's son with more brawn than sense. Ealdred, though too old to fight, accompanied them to the lord’s hall as advisor.

Lord Cynric, a grim-faced noble with a hawk upon his arm, stood before a hearth of roaring flames. “The Danes grow bold,” he said. “And in these woods, something stirs. Oswin is not the only one gone missing.”

He turned to Ealdred. “What say the old songs, wise one? Does the forest hold secrets still?”

Ealdred nodded. “There are tales, my lord. Of the Wyrm of Wyrmwood—a serpent spirit bound beneath the roots of the elder trees. It sleeps unless stirred by blood.”

Part III: The Shadow Beneath the Trees

Lord Cynric ordered a band to investigate the woods. Aethelbald, Ceolric, a monk named Brother Anselm, and two of the lord’s huscarls entered the Whispering Woods at dawn. For three days, they found nothing but mist, animal tracks, and abandoned huts.

On the fourth night, they discovered Oswin—or what remained of him. His body was torn, not by blade or beast, but scorched as if by fire. Beside him lay an ancient stone circle, moss-covered and cracked, with runes older than the Romans.

Brother Anselm wept and crossed himself. “This is no man’s doing. This is a place cursed by the old gods.”

Ceolric scoffed. “Curse or not, we ought burn it to the ground.”

But as he approached with torch in hand, the ground trembled. From beneath the stones, a groaning echoed. A serpentine head, black as midnight and crowned with horns, rose from the soil.

“The Wyrm!” Anselm cried. “The Wyrm awakens!”

The men fought bravely, but one by one fell. Aethelbald alone escaped, wounded and terrified, fleeing through bramble and brook until he stumbled into Elderglen by dawn’s light.

Part IV: Fire and Fate

The villagers gathered, pale with dread, as Aethelbald told of the Wyrm. Ealdred stood silently, then spoke.

“There is but one way to bind the spirit again. A sacrifice—a soul willingly given beneath the stone circle, with the chant of the old tongue.”

“I will go,” said Leofwyn, Oswin’s widow. “He died in that place. Let me meet him again—and end the beast.”

Father Edric protested, but Leofwyn was resolute. Ealdred led her to the stones that eve, and the village watched from afar. As the sun set, she knelt and sang the song of binding that Ealdred had taught her. The Wyrm rose once more—but made no move. With a final breath, Leofwyn cast herself into its maw. The Wyrm groaned, turned to stone, and the woods grew silent.

Part V: Legend and Legacy

Years passed. The tale of the Wyrm of Elderglen became legend. The stone circle remained, shunned by most, yet wildflowers grew around it.

Aethelbald became smith and elder, teaching children what Ealdred had taught him. And in the chapel, a new carving appeared: a woman with arms raised, facing a dragon of stone—Leofwyn, the Widow of Elderglen.

And so the village endured. For in the time of old England, where magic still danced beneath moonlight and the boundary between man and myth was thin, courage was the truest coin.
